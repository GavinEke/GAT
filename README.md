Scripts:

* `Disable-Win10Telemetry.ps1` - For Windows 10 - sets telemetry to only send security or basic information.
* `Enable-RDP.ps1` - For Windows 7+ - enables remote desktop and adds firewall exceptions.
* `Remove-GWX.ps1` - For Windows 7/8.1 - stops GWX program from trying to perform Windows 10 upgrade.
* `Remove-WinAppxBloat.ps1` - For Windows 8+ - removes all AppX packages not in the pre-defined RequiredPackages variable.
* `Get-ProfileBanner.ps1` - Windows 10 (1607)/Windows Server 2016 - displays a banner with system information about the host.

*Note: `Script1.ps1` is part of something I am working on, it won't work without the database setup so just ignore that.
